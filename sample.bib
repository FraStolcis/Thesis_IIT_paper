abstract = {Acquiring, representing and modelling human skills is one of the key research areas in teleoperation, programming-by-demonstration and human-machine collaborative settings. The problems are challenging mainly because of the lack of a general mathematical model to describe human skills. One of the common approaches is to divide the task that the operator is executing into several subtasks or low-level subsystems in order to provide manageable modelling. In this paper we consider the use of a Layered Hidden Markov Model (LHMM) to model human skills. We evaluate a gesteme classifier that classifies motions into basic action-primitives, or gestemes. The gesteme classifiers are then used in a LHMM to model a teleoperated task. The proposed methodology uses three different HMM models at the gesteme level: one-dimensional HMM, multi-dimensional HMM and multi-dimensional HMM with Fourier transform. The online and off-line classification performance of these three models is evaluated with respect to the number of gestemes, the influence of the number of training samples, the effect of noise and the effect of the number of observation symbols. We also apply the LHMM to data recorded during the execution of a trajectory tracking task in 2D and 3D with a mobile manipulator in order to provide qualitative as well as quantitative results for the proposed approach. The results indicate that the LHMM is suitable for modelling teleoperative trajectory-tracking tasks and that the difference in classification performance between one and multidimensional HMMs for gesteme classification is small. It can also be seen that the LHMM is robust with respect to misclassifications in the underlying gesteme classifiers.}

abstract = { In shared autonomy, a user and autonomous system work together to achieve shared goals. To collaborate effectively, the autonomous system must know the user’s goal. As such, most prior works follow a predict-then-act model, first predicting the user’s goal with high confidence, then assisting given that goal. Unfortunately, confidently predicting the user’s goal may not be possible until they have nearly achieved it, causing predict-then-act methods to provide little assistance. However, the system can often provide useful assistance even when confidence for any single goal is low (e.g. move towards multiple goals). In this work, we formalize this insight by modeling shared autonomy as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), providing assistance that minimizes the expected cost-to-go with an unknown goal. As solving this POMDP optimally is intractable, we use hindsight optimization to approximate. We apply our framework to both shared-control teleoperation and human–robot teaming. Compared with predict-then-act methods, our method achieves goals faster, requires less user input, decreases user idling time, and results in fewer user–robot collisions. }

However, RNNs consisting of sigma cells or tanh cells are unable to learn the relevant information of input data when the input gap is large. By introducing gate functions into the cell structure, the long short-term memory (LSTM) could handle the problem of long-term dependencies well. Since its introduction, almost all the exciting results based on RNNs have been achieved by the LSTM. The LSTM has become the focus of deep learning. We review the LSTM cell and its variants to explore the learning capacity of the LSTM cell. Furthermore, the LSTM networks are divided into two broad categories: LSTM-dominated networks and integrated LSTM networks. In addition, their various applications are discussed. Finally, future research directions are presented for LSTM networks.}",

  abstract = {The author describes a path planning technique for robotic manipulators and mobile robots in the presence of stationary obstacles. The planning consists of applying potential fields around configuration-space obstacles and using these fields to select a safe path for the robot to follow. The advantage of using potential fields in path planning is that they offer a relatively fast and effective way to solve for safe paths around obstacles. In the proposed method of path planning, a trial path is chosen and then modified under the influence of the potential field until an appropriate path is found. By considering the entire path, the problem of being trapped in a local minimum is greatly reduced, allowing the method to be used for global planning. The algorithm was tried with success on many different realistic planning problems. By way of illustration, the algorithm is applied to a two-dimensional revolute manipulator, a mobile robot capable of translation only, and a mobile robot capable of both translation and rotation.},
